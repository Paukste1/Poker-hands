# Poker-hands

## The process
First step was to figure our a way to approach the task. There were a few factors I had to take into account:
- To store all the hand combinations to memory, or taking them line by line in order to compare them;
- How to determine combinations of the given hand; (Observed that only 3 combinations include the suits and all 10 include the values)
- How to quantize the combination, so that they would be comparable;
